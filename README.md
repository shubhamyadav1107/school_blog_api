# School Blog API

Welcome to **School Blog API**! A powerful and efficient solution for managing blog posts within a school environment. This project consists of two main components:
1. **FastAPI Backend**: A RESTful API to manage blog data, written using **FastAPI**.
2. **Streamlit Frontend**: A simple user interface to interact with the blog API, allowing users to view and add blog posts.

---

## Project Overview

**School Blog API** allows users to perform the following operations:
- **Create Blog Posts**: Add new blog posts to the system.
- **Read Blog Posts**: Fetch all or specific blog posts.
- **CRUD Operations**: Easily manage your blog data with the power of FastAPI, MongoDB, and Streamlit.

This project is designed to serve as a full-stack web application where FastAPI handles the backend logic and data management, while Streamlit provides a sleek and interactive frontend for users.

## Key Features

- **FastAPI Backend**: Fast, modern, and flexible web framework for building APIs.
- **MongoDB Database**: Store your blog posts in MongoDB, a scalable NoSQL database.
- **Pydantic Data Validation**: Ensure data integrity and validity with Pydantic models.
- **Streamlit Frontend**: A beautifully simple interface to interact with the API, built with Streamlit.
- **Swagger Documentation**: Access the API documentation at `/docs` to interact with the API endpoints.

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- **Virtual Environment** (Recommended for managing dependencies)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/school_blog_api.git
cd school_blog_api
```

### 2. Set up Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Mac/Linux
.\venv\Scripts\activate    # For Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all necessary libraries listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Running the FastAPI Backend

Start the FastAPI backend server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

This will start the API at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 5. Running the Streamlit Frontend

In a new terminal window (while the FastAPI server is running), navigate to the project folder and run Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the frontend on `http://localhost:8501`.

## API Documentation

Once the FastAPI backend is running, you can access the full API documentation at:

- **FastAPI Docs**: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
- **Swagger UI**: Visualize and interact with the API using the Swagger interface.

The API exposes the following endpoints:

- `GET /blogs`: Retrieve all blog posts.

- `POST /blogs`: Create a new blog post.
- `PUT /blogs/{blog_id}`: Update an existing blog post.
- `DELETE /blogs/{blog_id}`: Delete a blog post.
